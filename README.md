Attendance Management System

Created an end-to-end Attendance Management System using OpenCV, Django, Dlib, HTML, and CSS.

The main objective was to create an application that converted the incumbent manual process of attendance tracking of employees to one that can be achieved with ease using facial recognition.

In addition, the application provides attendance reports to track vital trends and leaves.

The goal was to create a tool that can be integrated with several APIs and biometric devices to help revolutionize companies' attendance management process.
